Understanding A/B testing.
==========================

Marketing and programming have something in common: testing.
Testing in programming is done to catch syntax and logic bugs.
In marketing, testing is used to measure the effect of a change, and
to learn about the market.

Programming uses various methods of testing, such as unit testing. Marketing
does have various methods, but the most widely used is called A/B testing. Where
you test a change against a control. Some people recommend using what is called
the *multi-armed-bandit method*, which calls for testing various changes at the same
time. I do not use it because it tends to make data harder to analyze, and does
increase (in my experience) the margin of error (by a significant amount).

##A look at a basic A/B test. 

We are going to test your landing page. It has a button with the following call to action:
*Click here to signup.* The test aims to find out if another call to action would improve
signups. The new call to action is: *Singup now. Its Free!*

With your A/B testing framework of choice (I will cover these very soon)
you split your traffic in a 50/50 ratio. Meaning that half of the visitors
will see your current call to action (from now the *CTA*), and the other half will
see the new CTA.

You will then measure the amount of signups and compare the results from both CTAs.
If there is a negative change in your control group, then the test proved that
the current CTA works drives more visitors to sign up. And vice-versa. Simple stuff.

##Where things get interesting.

Go back to when I said that:

    In marketing, testing is used to measure the effect of a change, and
    to learn about the market.
    
Measuring change is simple to understand. I change something. Measure to see 
if it works. But the interesting part of testing is that it provides a close
look at the market that you are marketing to.

A lot of people out there don't understand that a failed A/B test is very valuable.
Because it means that you are potentially attracting a different market than
the one you are catering to. This means that you may have different profit channels
from the same product.
    
Anytime a test I do comes back as negative the market is re-analyzed. What new
market is interested in my product but not converting due to the marketing?
Who are these people? My quest is now to not only keep testing for the current
market, but to also include tests to find this new demographic. So each A/B test
will include a tool for me to try and get those people to come forward and identify themselves.

##Money rules.

Some founders pay too much attention to the amount of people who convert into customers
and not to how much money each customer brings in. There is a fallacy out there that
more customers == more money. (!true) Not True.

You test to learn what makes you the most money, not what brings in more customers.
If your base product costs $5/month and brings in 100K customers, but your deluxe
version costs $100 and brings in 1K customers, which do you think is more profitable?
The deluxe product, of course. Less customers to take care of means less infrastructure
to pay for (less overhead). Your A/B testing should focus on finding what makes you
the most money, and not the most customers. That is why you have to pay special attention
to sales figures from A/B tests.

If your A/B test showed more sales, but the average transaction amount went *down*,
then the test failed. Pay attention to sales numbers, and don't make traffic/conversions
your main metric.

Real traction is measured in dollards and not users. I know of startups with
millions of dollars in sales with less than 10 customers. Huge traction. Less than
a dozen customers.

##The end of this test.

This is a fairly high level look at A/B testing, but a good introduction for those
new to it. In the near future, I will publish a detailed guide to A/B testing
in the newsletter. Subscribe and don't miss it.
