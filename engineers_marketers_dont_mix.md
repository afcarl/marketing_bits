Why marketing and engineers don't mix.
=======================================

Let me start by saying that it is the marketer's fault that engineers don't take marketing seriously. As an engineer and marketer I see the issue from both sides. Engineers are not without fault, but 90% of the blame falls on the shoulders of marketers.

Here is why.

##You don't know how to communicate with engineers. 

Engineers have a need to make sense. Everything is either right or wrong. There are very few gray areas. But you constantly communicate in ways that leave a lot open for interpretation. You can't really BS an engineer. Just don't go there.

Stop using buzzwords. They might impress the big dummy in the suit, but not the guy who cut his teeth  writing calculus while the rest of the world got drunk drinking tequila during finals week.Let me give you a real world example of buzzwords that make you look stupid.

This from the twitter profile of a marketer focused on working with startups:

    A process thinker specializing in bringing Lean and continuous improvement processes to sales and marketing.

What does that even mean? The person specializes in improving your sales and marketing by implementing a process that is somewhat related to agile development. 


##You don't use data correctly.

Engineers hate statistics. They know any statistic can be twisted into proving any specific point. They are practically useless. What you need to bring to the table are hard test numbers. Bring the tech, and not the results. Prepare it in a manner that they can sit down and run the numbers. You can improve their conversion rates with some A/B testing? Make sure to include them in the test setup. Its more work for you, but it will give them a better understanding of why and how you do it. Plus they will appreciate your effort to openly discuss the data.


##You focus too much on image and status.

Engineers don't put as much value in either. Sure, they are important, but not as important as data. Stop trying to sell them in a way that aims to improve their social status. They don't care. Engineers don't buy Porches because they are luxury cars. They buy them because Porsches are engineering art pieces specially bred under the most demanding racing conditions.
Its important, but takes a back seat to other tangible factors.
 

##You don't make an effort to work with engineers.

I only know of two marketers who actually take the time to work with engineers, and one of them is me (the other is Patrick McKenzie).
The rest of you expect engineers to come to you. Not going to happen. They are too busy building things. That is why they fail so much when the time to sell a product arrives. Having spent so much time developing a product in a vacuum warps their understanding of market needs. That's why its so important that you go to them. Engineers need marketers to help them build a product that will sell. But they will not work with anyone who will not not an effort to work with them.

Yes, some engineers are a pain to work with. Yes, they are demanding. Yes, they will challenge everything you propose. But its not personal. They are trying to figure out if what you bring to the table makes sense. Constantly getting a lot of negative feedback from them means that you are not communicating effectively. And not that they don't get marketing. Its you that doesn't get them.

##The close.

Next time you talk to an engineer just ask questions. Don't talk and listen. Shut up for once. Pay attention to the way they communicate. Thats the key to having them hire you to help build their product. Buzzwords will only ban you in their minds.
